    "welcomeMessage": "The University of Marburg celebrates its 500th anniversary in 2027. These celebrations are accompanied by the Knowledge Spaces research project. The goal is to explore the history of science through university architecture.\n\nWhile much has been written about individual professors, others and especially research and teaching practices as well as everyday life in the city and at the university often remain in the dark. We need you to help add these missing puzzle pieces to the overall picture! Help us bring university history to life with your knowledge and memories by sharing your stories about one or more buildings. What took place in which building? Who taught where and how? What research projects were being worked on during your time? How has the cityscape changed? Where did you discuss with your people? What do you know about the history of science and university buildings? These and many other aspects help complete the picture. Use the preset fields, add more, or share your knowledge in the free text field. We look forward to your contribution.\n\nWhile entering your information, the data is stored in cookies before being converted into a markdown file and stored in the university's internal Gitlab after submission. The Knowledge Spaces team will then evaluate the data and incorporate the information, as much as possible, into Wikimedia family formats (Wikipedia, Wikidata, Wikicommons etc.) to keep the data sustainably accessible and updatable for the public even after the anniversary year and the end of the Knowledge Spaces project. At the same time, an app will be designed with the knowledge that goes beyond just hard facts and data, bringing the history of science and everyday life at Philipps University to life. We would therefore be very pleased if we could engage in an exchange with you about the alma mater and if you would contribute to the anniversary. After the anniversary year or when you inform us beforehand, we will of course delete all personal data and information from the web form. Until then, only members of the Knowledge Spaces project team have access to your data and information.\n\nWe need your email address so that we can contact you if we have questions about your entries, especially in the free text field.\n\nIf you have any further questions, feel free to take a look at the FAQ on the next page or contact the Knowledge Spaces team directly. You can reach us by email at andreas.schuebeler@staff.uni-marburg.de.",
